## Research Sources

For each program, use these sources in order of priority:

1. **Official program website** - Always primary source
2. **Program social media** - For recent updates
3. **CollegeVine/PrepScholar** - For acceptance rates, tips
4. **College Confidential forums** - For student experiences (verify dates)

**Never rely solely on third-party aggregators for dates, costs, or requirements.**

## Notes for Researchers

1. **Always verify the year** - Confirm all data is for 2026
2. **Check application status** - Note if applications are open, closed, or dates TBA
3. **Record acceptance rates** - Essential for `llmContext`
4. **Note cost and aid** - Include financial aid availability
5. **Capture unique value** - What makes this program special?
6. **Consider alternatives** - Note similar programs for different student profiles
