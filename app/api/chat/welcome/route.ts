/**
 * Welcome Message API
 * Generates an AI-powered initial greeting based on user context
 *
 * Optimized for speed:
 * - Uses in-memory cache for profile data (~1ms vs ~1000ms)
 * - Uses Kimi K2 via Groq for fast generation (~300ms)
 *
 * Also saves the welcome message to the database so it appears when resuming
